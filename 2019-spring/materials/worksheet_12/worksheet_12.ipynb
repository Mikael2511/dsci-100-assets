    "# Visualizing high dimensional data \n",
    "\n",
    "> One of the problems that we encounter when doing data science is the high dimensionality of our datasets. We have multiple variables that we wish to look at the same time to understand the processes and patterns going on in there. However, we can only see up to 3 dimensions ([really only 2 well](http://scecinfo.usc.edu/geowall/stereohow.html), so even when we get to a dataset like the iris dataset, which only contains 4 variables aside from the species labels, we can't fully visualize what's going on. One solution is to visualize it across multiple 2D plots (as you did in the last tutorial) but that can be sub-optimal. Is there nothing else we can do? No! There are alternatives. In general the broad category of algorithms used for this and other problems of high dimensionality is named dimensionality reduction. One of the most famous and used techniques is called t-SNE. (\n",
    "\n",
    "In this worksheet, we will demonstrate how you can do t-sne in R to visualize the high-dimensional data sets you were working with in your clustering tutorial. We do not expect you to be able to explain how this algorithm works, but we we do expect you to learn and remember is the following:\n",
